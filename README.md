##Description:
File handling in Java is the process of creating, reading, writing, and modifying files using Java’s built-in classes from packages such as java.io and java.nio.file. It allows programs to store and retrieve data permanently, even after the program stops running. Java provides various classes like File, FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter to perform file operations efficiently.
For this program, I used the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor as my development environment. The code was written, compiled, and executed in VS Code’s integrated terminal, which provided a simple and efficient workflow for writing and testing Java programs.
